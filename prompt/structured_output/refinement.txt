# Topic Merging Prompt (Simplified)

You will receive a list of topics that belong to the same level of a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify and merge topics that are paraphrases or near duplicates of one another.

**Instructions:**
- Return only the topics that were actually merged
- If no merging is needed, return an empty `merged_topics` array
- Each merged topic should contain the new combined topic and the original topics that were merged

**Response Format:**
```json
{{
  "merged_topics": [
    // Only include entries if topics were actually merged
    {{
      "merged_topic": {{
        "level": 1,
        "name": "New Combined Topic Name",
        "description": "Description covering the merged concepts"
      }},
      "original_topics": [
        {{
          "level": 1,
          "name": "First Original Topic",
          "description": "Original description"
        }},
        {{
          "level": 1,
          "name": "Second Original Topic", 
          "description": "Original description"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
```
